# Image_Classification_Using_Vision_Transformer

This repository contains the an end-to-end project for an image classification model. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify input flower images into different classes. It utilizes the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which has shown promising results in image classification tasks.

### Features
* Preprocessing to prepare the dataset for training.
* Patch Extraction.
* Class Tokens and Positional Embeddings.
* Creating layers used in Transformer's encoder.
* Implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model.
* Training the model on the dataset.
* Evaluating the trained model's performance.
* Pretrained weights for the ViT model.
### Dataset
The project uses the Kaggle Flower Classification dataset, a collection of images depicting various types of flowers. The dataset consists of images classified into 5 different flower classes. It is split into training and test sets for model development and evaluation.
